## Background
This is an application made in Angular. During summer of 2019 I have tried to grasp and learn React and Vue. It was very fun and I've followed some tutorials and tried as many aspects as possible. But I was a bit afraid of taking on Angular at the same time because taking on three frameworks at the same time was maybe too much for me. But I've decided to give Angular a shot so here we go.
